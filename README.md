# Welcome to the GitHub Source Code page of the Uyn BOT!

"Uyn" is a BOT that does many miscellaneous things like fun things, moderation things, and so on.

## How to run this BOT yourself?

* **Step 1:** Download [UynServer](https://www.github.com/LilShieru/UynServer) and config the PHP and the MySQL server.
* **Step 2:** Download the Uyn source code.
* **Step 3:** Configure the BOT prefix and owner's ID in the `config.json` file.
* **Step 4:** Config the Environment Variables: `BOT_TOKEN` with your BOT token, `php_server_url` with the URL of your PHP server, `php_server_token` with the token you configured in your PHP server, and `tenor_api_key` with your Tenor API Key.
* **Step 5:** Install the dependencies with the `npm install` command. You needn't to do it if you're using Heroku.
* **Step 6:** Run the BOT with the `node index.js` command. If you're in Heroku, make sure that you've enabled the `web` dyno in the `Resources` tab. If you prefer the `worker` dyno, change the `web: node index.js` into `worker: node index.js` in the `Procfile` file.
* **Step 7:** ENJOY!!! xD

By the way, I'm currently using THIS repository to deploy the code into my Heroku BOT app, so you don't worry about this code repo :D
